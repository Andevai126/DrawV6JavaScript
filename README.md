# DrawV6JavaScript
My own 3d renderer, version 6, implemented in JavaScript.

## Usage
1. Open the Repository in Visual Studio Code.
2. Right click on index.hmtl and click on "Open with Live Server Alt L Alt O"
3. The page should open automatically, otherwise go to http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html.
4. Click anywhere on the page to lock the mouse. You can exit with Esc.
5. Look around by moving the mouse, move horizontal with wasd, faster with Ctrl. Move vertical with Shift Spacebar or qe.
6. Change the gamemode with g. There are three options, flying, walking or rolling/bouncing.

## Notes
- I figured out rendering and camera movement with https://www.geogebra.org/3d/wnbpv4jv
- I figured out collision with https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ic2j6ijago and https://www.geogebra.org/m/ejqutre2
